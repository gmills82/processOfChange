# Process of Change 
A spring boot application that generates processes of change for characters. I am experimenting to see if this is helpful in character creation.

## Narrative gives meaning to reality
Narrative and story add meaning to the randomness of the events of our lives. We use stories to overcome challenges, to grow and develop of people, and to shape reality itself. Most religions are based around collections of narratives which inform us about our shared reality. The power of well written narative and story is often overlooked or downplayed but we all create this story in our subconciouses every day.

## Characters are central to narrative
Characters are the living beating hearts of our narratives. We relate best to characters whose struggles remind us of our own. When they triumph over adversity so do we and as they suffer we suffer alongside of them; growing all the while. Narratives without believable characters are ineffectual at conveying meaning and are usually uninteresting.

## Characters undergo transformation
Joseph Campbell covers the nearly universal idea of character transformation in *The Hero With A Thousand Faces*. To create heroes or villains who are relatable we must understand their process of change or transformation

## My process of change
1. Premonitions, Omens, Prophecy, and Dreams
	- The truth becomes known to the subconscious, but not to the conscious mind
	- External pressures erode away the conscious minds ability to protect itself from changes and the forces from the subconscious mind create a dilemma for the character and a call to action
2. Testing the Waters
	- The conscious mind tries to appease the desires of the subconscious mind in an effort to relieve pressure from the character and to protect them
	- Quick solutions are often attempted and exhausted instead of real change, evolutionary path of least resistance leads to less than optimal results in most cases
	- As the quick solutions are exhausted and the conscious mind begins to process even a portion of the amount of change required to protect the character it responds with fight, flight, or freeze reactions
3. The War of the Mind
	- The character is overwhelmed in some manner by its subconscious
	- The full scope of the transformation encapsulates and permeates the character
	- This often leads to unforeseeable consequences for the character, tragic or comedic
	- This often seems like a massacre, opening salvos of a war, a nuclear explosion, guerilla warfare, etc
4. Say it ain't so
	- Battles are lost and the future seems hopeless
	- Like trying to piece together the shifting sands to order the desert of their minds to the state it was in prior to the haboob
	- Bonds the reader with the character, creates tensions, will the character overcome and how?
	- Often lost in conversations and monologues exploring the why or the how of the transformation
	- This is the place of deepest pain for the character
5. Acceptance & Grief
	- 5 stages of grief often appear here in some form, usually not explicit or detailed by emotional
	- Questions shift from "Why and how did this happen?", to "What is the point of continuing on? Where do I go from here? What is the point of existing in a world like this?"
	- There is a strong risk of death at this phase
	- The past and present are always changing, it is our narrative about those events which allow us to accept these events and ourselves
	- The conclusions drawn here determine whether the character will become a hero or a villain,
6. Acceptance & World Building
	- Heroes choose their own beliefs about the world around them which allow them to continue on with his transformation.
	- Villains choose to believe the worst about the people around them and themselves.
	- Villains deny either their power and responsibility in creating and shaping reality **OR** they deny vulnerability to the external events of reality and claim a false power
	- Heroes understand their role in shaping reality and its balance with their vulnerability to the world. Having formed a moment of clarity that crystallizes their vision and purpose they are able to see the imbalance that weakens the villain's position are able to use that imbalance to defeat them. 
	- In understanding this they transcend reality itself and become legend.
	- A discovery of a larger peace, understood through narrative, which informs us of our vulnerability and power
	- Change. No transformation happens without it. It is the litmus test of the soul.
	- We must be the change we want to see in the world
