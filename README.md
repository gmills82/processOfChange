# Process of Change 
A spring boot application that generates processes of change for characters. I am experimenting to see if this is helpful in character creation.

## Narrative gives meaning to reality
Narrative and story add meaning to the randomness of the events of our lives. We use stories to overcome challenges, to grow and develop of people, and to shape reality itself. Most religions are based around collections of narratives which inform us about our shared reality. The power of well written narative and story is often overlooked or downplayed but we all create this story in our subconciouses every day.

## Relatability of characters
Characters are the living beating hearts of our narratives. We relate best to characters whose struggles remind us of our own. When they triump over adversity so do we and as they suffer we suffer alongside of them; growing all the while.
